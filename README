This project is an attempt to download last.fm stats and integrate them into the users desktop.
I haven't looked too deeply into how to do this, just something to work out in my spare time.

Current idea: Use weekly stats to generate a static image for the desktop.

Dependencies (so far):
cron
python-elementtree
